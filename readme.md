# What is the idea?

It is challenging for the aging population to keep the driving mobility and independence. By the EU regulations people over the age of 70 are required to pass eye-testing for the driving license renewal. The project team intends to develop a unified platform which would support managing certification processes and will be distributed among all of the process participants which includes patients, opticians and ophthalmologists.

# What are the requirements?

The platform should include the following functionality:

- registering patients, opticians and ophthalmologists;
- provide payment service for the eye-testing;
- upload of the patients’ retina images;
- storage of the medical information in accordance to DICOM standards of
- communication and data exchange;o security and safe accessibility of private
- medical data;
- distributing certified test results between theophthalmologists, patients and driving license renewal authorities;
- storage of patients’ medical information in records history;

By the scope of the involved process participants the platform should be deployed as a distributed database system which could be accessible by different groups of users from different sites as the system should operate in the EU countries where its components (servers, processors, etc.) are located. This would enable a sufficient level of systems’ concurrency and provide reliable web service for the users.
